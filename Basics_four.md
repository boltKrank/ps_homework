# Basics Four: Scope
Get a deep understanding of Scope.
Think about things such as:
Using variables from a params in the parameter area of a class or defined resource (how you would do this?)
Explain what influence a resource default in a calling class has on the included class.
Can inheritance be used with defined resources?
How can resource collectors be used to override resource values?  Provide examples with an explanation.
What issues can arise from using inheritance in Puppet to override variables and behaviour of parents' resources?
What occurs if you define a resource default in site.pp?
Write a report on scope and include code examples.
