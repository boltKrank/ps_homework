# Basics Four: Scope

## Task requirements:

Get a deep understanding of Scope.

Think about things such as:

- Using variables from a params in the parameter area of a class or defined resource (how you would do this?)
- Explain what influence a resource default in a calling class has on the included class.
- Can inheritance be used with defined resources?
- How can resource collectors be used to override resource values?  Provide examples with an explanation.
- What issues can arise from using inheritance in Puppet to override variables and behaviours of parents' resources?
- What occurs if you define a resource default in site.pp?
Write a report on scope and include code examples.


## Report:

In Puppet variable values can be defined in various places, not necessarily in the class/file you are working in or referencing from.
