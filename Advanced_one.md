Advanced One: Virtual Resources, Auto-tagging, and Scope
The PSE should use the module downloadable from https://github.com/beergeek/scoping.git
The PSE requires a full PE master and agent (a separate agent makes this easier).
Look at the module and understand what is being attempted.
Classify the node with scoping::test_out, run Puppet and observe results.
Reclassify the node with scoping::test_in_0, run Puppet and observe.
Explain, IN DETAIL, why all the virtual resources were realised.
Reclassify the node with scoping::test_in_1 and prove your theory is correct.
Send your explanation to your manager.
